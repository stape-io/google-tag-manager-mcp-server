Fix `gtm_destination` crashing with `allItems.slice is not a function` when the Google API returns an empty object for a container with no linked Google Tags, and rename the tool to `gtag_destination` to reflect that it manages Google Tags (tagmanager.google.com/#/home#tags), not classic GTM container destinations. Also removed the `get`, `link`, and `unlink` actions: `get`/`link` are deprecated by Google and `unlink` was never part of the API; `list` is now the only supported action.
